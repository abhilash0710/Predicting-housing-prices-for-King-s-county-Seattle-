Performed data pre-processing to understand the distribution of categorical, numerical variables and highlight outliers.
Developed ML models using Scikit-learn (supervised learning along with dimensionality reduction, ensemble learning).
Applied Grid Search Cross-Validation for models with hyper-parameters to come up with the best model as Linear Regressor (80.94%) followed by Ridge Regressor (80.93%) for predicting house prices.
